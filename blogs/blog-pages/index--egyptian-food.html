                        <p class="blog-text">Koshari is Egypt's national dish and one of the most iconic street foods in Cairo. It's a hearty, carb-loaded bowl made from layers of rice, macaroni, lentils, chickpeas, tangy tomato sauce, fried onions, garlic vinegar, and spicy chili sauce.</p>
                        <p class="blog-text">Originating from a similar Indian dish called "khichdi," Egyptians transformed it into a local favorite by adding pasta and bold flavors. Today, koshari is a symbol of local life‚Äîaffordable, filling, and irresistibly tasty. It's perfect for vegetarians, budget travelers, or anyone who loves strong, comforting flavors.</p>

                        <p class="blog-text">Taameya is the Egyptian version of falafel‚Äîbut with a twist. Unlike Levantine falafel made with chickpeas, taameya is crafted from crushed fava beans, blended with fresh herbs like parsley, dill, and coriander, then deep-fried to crispy perfection.</p>
                        <p class="blog-text">Served in pita bread with tahini, salad, and pickles, taameya is a staple Egyptian breakfast. It's vegan, nutritious, cheap, and exploding with green, herby flavor. Ideal for street food lovers and those seeking plant-based options.</p>

                        <p class="blog-text">This gelatin-rich dish is a winter favorite in Cairo, especially among those seeking a heavy, warming meal. It's best paired with hot chili sauce and a squeeze of lemon to balance its richness.</p>
